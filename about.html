    <p>Wayne is a young smart energetic Kenyan currently pursuing Architecture in JKUAT. Currenly I am at Moringa trying to improve my programming skills.
Academically, I am interesed designing especially building stuctures. I would like my career to revolve around design, which I fondly call “the art of perceiving”, for I believe in the power of designg to induce change personally and globally. The capacity of design to make someone happy or sad has impressed me so much. To me, dsign is like math wherein one has to master and know a workable formula to deliver the right message.
I dedicate myself in providing help to students as well as to professionals who are having a difficult time in creating working designs, coding, or any creation elements. I also offer tutorials for students who want to learn how to design themselves. I provide efficient lessons and exercises that help students develop their designing skills or even discover their hidden talents in designg.
It is my vision for all people to once again appreciate the art of creating through design. With the rapid development of technology, young people are losing this skill. It is my mission to help students slow down and truly articulate what they are trying to say. </p>
